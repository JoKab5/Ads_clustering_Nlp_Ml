This project is an innovative machine learning model for evaluating student summaries.

This model is designed to assess a student's ability to accurately capture the main idea and relevant details of a text, also by taking into account the clarity, precision, and fluency of language used. 

Using the latest advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including language models to evaluate the degree of similarity between the source text and the summary, combined with qualitative summary analysis through NLP techniques and the use of the XGBoost algorithm, our model accurately predicts the score assigned to a summary in relation to the text.
